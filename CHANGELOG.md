# Changelog

The repo is versioned based on [SemVer 2.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) using the tiny-but-mighty [MinVer](https://github.com/adamralph/minver) from [@adamralph](https://github.com/adamralph). [See here](https://github.com/adamralph/minver#how-it-works) for more information on how it works.

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

The `Unreleased` section name is replaced by the expected version of next release. A stable version's log contains all changes between that version and the previous stable version (can duplicate the prereleases logs).

## [Unreleased]

- `dotnet new eqxetl` template, providing a CosmosDb `ChangeFeedProcessor` that ingests/transforms/filters documents from a source store, feeding events (consistently) into an `Equinox.Cosmos` store [#17](https://github.com/jet/dotnet-templates/pull/17)

### Changed

- `dotnet new eqxweb` now uses Anonymous Records syntax HT [@ameier38](https://github.com/ameier38)
