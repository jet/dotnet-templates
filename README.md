# Jet `dotnet new` Templates

This repo hosts the source for Jet's [`dotnet new`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new) templates. While that's presently just for [Equinox](https://github.com/jet/equinox), over time the intention is to add templates for other systems where relevant.

## Available Templates

- [`eqxweb`](equinox-web/README.md) - Boilerplate for an ASP .NET Core Web App, with an associated storage-independent Domain project.
- [`eqxwebcs`](equinox-web-csharp/README.md) - Boilerplate for an ASP .NET Core Web App, with an associated storage-independent Domain project _ported to C#_.
- [`eqxprojector`](equinox-projector-cosmos/README.md) - Boilerplate for a CosmosDb ChangeFeedProcessor, with optional projection to Apache Kafka and associated consumer logic.

## How to use

As dictated by [the design of dotnet's templating mechanism](https://github.com/dotnet/templating/), consumption is ultimately via the .NET Core SDK's `dotnet new` CLI facility and/or associated facilities in Visual Studio, Rider etc.

To use from the command line, the outline is:
  1. Install a template locally (use `dotnet new --list` to view your current list)
  2. Use `dotnet new` to expand the template in a given directory

    # install the templates into `dotnet new`s list of available templates so it can be picked up by
    # `dotnet new`, Rider, Visual Studio etc.
    dotnet new -i Equinox.Templates

    # --help shows the options including wiring for storage subsystems,
    # -t includes an example Domain, Handler, Service and Controller to test from app to storage subsystem
    dotnet new eqxweb -t --help

    # if you want to see a C# equivalent:
    dotnet new eqxwebcs -t

    # see readme.md in the generated code for further instructions regarding the TodoBackend the above -t switch above triggers the inclusion of
    start readme.md

    # to add a Projector and a Consumer (-k emits to Kafka and hence implies having a Consumer)
    dotnet new eqxprojector -k

## CONTRIBUTING

Please don't hesitate to [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/jet/dotnet-templates/issues/new) for any questions so others can benefit from the discussion. For any significant planned changes or additions, please err on the side of [reaching out early](https://github.com/jet/dotnet-templates/issues/new) so we can align expectationss - there's nothing more frustrating than having your hard work not yielding a mutually agreeable result ;)

### Contribution guidelines - `equinox-*` templates

See [the Equinox repo's CONTRIBUTING section](https://github.com/jet/equinox/blob/master/README.md#contributing) for general guidelines wrt how contributions are considered specifically wrt Equinox.

The following sorts of things are top of the list for the `eqx*` templates at the present time:

- Fixes for typos, adding of info to the readme or comments in the emitted code etc
- Small-scale cleanup or clarifications of the emitted code
- support for additional languages in the templates
- further straightforward starter projects

While there is no rigid or defined limit to what makes sense to add, it should be borne in mind that `dotnet new eqx*` is often going to be a new user's first interaction with Equinox and/or [asp]dotnetcore. Hence there's a delicate (and intrinsically subjective) balance to be struck between:

  1. simplicity of programming techniques used / beginner friendliness
  2. brevity of the generated code
  3. encouraging good design practices
