/// Process Manager used to:
/// - Coordinate competing attempts to transfer quantities from stock; if balance is 3 one of contesting requests to remove 2 or 3 items must reach `Failed`
/// - maintain rolling balance of stock levels per Location
/// - while recording any transfers or adjustment in an overall Inventory record
/// The Process is driven by two collaborating actors:
/// 1) The 'happy path', where a given actor is executing the known steps of the command flow
///    In the normal case, such an actor will bring the flow to a terminal state (Completed or Failed)
/// 2) A watchdog-projector, which reacts to observed events in this Category by stepping in to complete in-flight requests that have stalled
///    This represents the case where a 'happy path' actor died, or experienced another impediment on the path.
